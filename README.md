# Full-Precision Calculator Application
A calculator application that is programmed in a way that overcomes the machine's computational limitations.

# What computational limitations?
Here are some examples:
- Some programming languages (such as C) have number types (such as int and float) that, depending on the machine, has a limit in which computations cannot be done for numbers above that limit.
- Calculators only display division results up to less than 100 significant digits.
- In machines, numbers are stored in binary, and seemingly terminating decimals that are repeating in binary (such as 0.1) causes some operations to not follow logic (such as Python 3 stating 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.3 as False)

# How will these limitations be overcome?
This calculator will refrain from using the built-in mathematical operations at all, and instead take advantage of strings and classes as well as functions and methods.

# Current state of development
Currently, it is under development using Python 3.
Unfortunately, this calculator application is still in its very early stages that not even the very first version is finished; It is planned to be finished by the end of September 2016.
